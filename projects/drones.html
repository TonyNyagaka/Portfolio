    <img src="../clientele/drone.jpeg">

        <p>There is a lot of information out there about the finest drones available in the market and hence it can be confusing for a drone enthusiast to figure out which drones actually take the prize.</p>

        <p>This article breaks down the best choices of drones meant for different purposes while still putting the highest quality, popularity and features into consideration.</p>

    <h2>The best camera drones</h2>
    <h3>DJI Phantom 4</h3>
        <p>All pundits agree that this is DJI’s finest innovation in the technology of drones and I would argue that this by far the best camera drone .If you are looking for the best professional videos then this is the drone for you; it offers a 4k video that comes with impeccable 12 Megapixel photos.</p>

        <p>While this drone is easy to fly, it also boasts of unmatched power and pace. Some other important features of this drone include: obstacle avoidance; this allows the drone avoid obstruction while it is moving, approximately 24 minutes of flight and it can be controlled using a smart phone.</p>

        <p>All this amazing features that make the DJI Phantom stand out among its peers will cost you a good sum; as it stands the drone goes for $ 1,399.</p>

    <h3>DJI Phantom 3 Professional</h3>
        <p>The Phantom 3 has to be one of the most popular drones for those who enjoy piloting drones as a hobby.</p>

        <p>It can be easily be controlled by pretty much everyone because it has the ‘’Follow me’’ feature that prevents it from straying away and also the ability to land automatically when the flight time is over.</p>

    <h3>3DR Solo</h3>
        <p>This drone is perfect when it comes to capturing those extremely difficult but priceless shots any photographer dreams of because it uses the Go Pro Hero 4 in the place of a built-in camera.</p>

        <p>It has a lot of similarities with the Phantom 3 only that the user has the ability to upgrade it for better output.</p>

        <p>This drone can be acquired for only $ 999 with the option of adding a GoPro Hero and 3DR gimbal for approximately $1900. If this price puts you off, then I recommend the Phantom 3 since it can equally produce high quality videos.</p>

    <h2>The best racing drones</h2>
        <p>Some drones have been manufactured with features that are adaptable to the sport of racing which involves a number of competitors. These drones are lighter so that they can move faster and also very hard because of the numerous crashes.</p>

        <h3>TBS Vendetta</h3>
            <p>This is by far the best First Person View racing drone in the market. It is packaged ready to fly but you will need to purchase FPV goggles for an immersive experience, a charger, battery and a controller.</p>

        <p>The TBS Vendetta just like other racing drones is tiny in size but it can spectacularly shoot to a speed of 70mph  or even more while on a track, this can even go up past 100mph when nose diving.</p>

        <h3>Immersion RC Vortex 250 Pro</h3>
            <p>The stand-out feature of this ready-to-fly quadcopter is that it has two instead of three or four bladed propellers. The two blades have an advantage of adding efficiency of the drone while three blades provide more power.</p>

    <h2>The best drone for beginners</h2>
        <p>When learning how to pilot a drone you will realize that there is a lot of crashing involved. This might result in you spending a lot of money on repairs and maintenance; it is important to know which drone can withstand a lot of crashing with minimum damage while still being cost-effective.</p>
