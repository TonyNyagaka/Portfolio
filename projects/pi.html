    <h1>Stablecoin Administrators to Register as MSB with FinCEN</h1>
    <img src="../clientele/Crypto.jpeg">

        <p>'Just because you say you are a banana doesn't make you a banana,' Director Kenneth Blanco of The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said to reinforce the Network's stand on stablecoins falling under their mandate to protect 'money transmission services'.</p>

        <p>Blanco said FinCEN holds on to its 'technology neutral' stance in having stablecoins regarded under money transmission services. This was at Chainalysis Links conference held in New York City on Friday.</p>

        <p>'It does not matter if the stablecoin is backed by a currency, a commodity, or even an algorithm â€“ the rules are the same,' Blanco said.</p>

        <p>America's anti-money laundering regulator's elucidation on the matter came as Blanco stood his ground on having stablecoin administrators enroll as Money Services Business (MSB) with FinCEN.</p>

        <p>FinCEN is a branch of the Treasury Department that probes into financial crimes such as money laundering through a look into transaction records and data.</p>

        <p>Having stablecoins as money transmitters, while their administrators as MSBs translates to firms involved with them adhering to federal know-your-customer (KYC) and AML laws outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
        
        <p>The issuing of stablecoins is pegged on reserve assets, often, the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis or attached to a basket of currencies. They can also employ other techniques to minimize their price volatility; Dai, the MakerDAO token, uses algorithms for stability while Bitcoin, on the other hand, trades freely.</p>

        <p>This according to Kenneth Blanco is a distinction without a difference.</p>

        <p>'FinCEN applies the same technology-neutral regulatory framework to any activity that provides the same functionality as the same level of risk, regardless of its label. It is not what you label it, it's the activity you actually do that counts,' Blanco commented.</p>
        
        <p>The director's views usher in legal lucidity to the ever-evolving crypto sector as recently witnessed big-name storylines such as the Libra Project by Facebook hitting the headlines globally.</p>
        
        <p>'But the stablecoin concept is not new,' Blanco said on Friday. This is so as FinCEN started having a look into stablecoins during crypto's infant stages and later issuing guidance on the same in 2008. He added that the widespread public interest signified the need for clarification.</p>
        
        <p>From earlier decisions, FinCEN had money transmission service on ICO issuers but of late they have been placed on various decentralized applications.</p>

        <p>Blanco's statements on Friday underscores a recent remark he made: there is no excuse for non-compliance. Not in money transmission or in the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force's Travel Rule.</p>

        <p>He adds, 'You can't build a car that only goes 150 miles per hour and ask us to change the speed limit. That's not happening. Build your car to meet the requirements.'</p>
