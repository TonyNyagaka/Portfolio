    <h1>Dehumidifiers</h1>
    <img src="/clientele/dehumidifiers.jpeg">
        <p>By definition, a dehumidifier is a household apparatus that helps to reduce the level of humidity in the air. High humidity levels in a room can make it inhabitable and this machine helps to make life comfortable by regulating humidity. The dehumidifier was invented in 1948 by Carl Munters.</p>

    <h2>How it works: </h2>
        <p>The dehumidifier has components that work together to meet the goal. First, a fan inside the gadget collects moist air from the surroundings through a duct. The sucked air moves past the cool coils of a rotating wheel inside the dehumidifier. This water-absorbing material condenses the air to pull moisture out of it. The coils then gather the moisture and it eventually dribbles into the dehumidifier’s reservoir.</p>

        <p>The dehumidifier finally warms the air and debilitates it back into the room through an exhaust duct. The emitted dry air blends with moist air in the room making it drier. It is pulled back into the unit over and over again to become drier until the entire room is free from moisture. A hose connected to the unit empties the reservoir once it is filled with water.</p>


    <h2>Is Dehumidifier water distilled?</h2>
        <p>The process of dehumidification is not that different from regular distillation. In any case, both result in evaporated and condensed water. But, dehumidifier water is not distilled water. This is because the environment inside the dehumidifier is unsterilized serving as an open situation for micro-organisms. In addition, substantial metals inside the tank are constantly present meaning it is contaminated with metal residue.</p>

    
    <h2>Is Dehumidifier water safe to drink?</h2>
        <p>Water from a dehumidifier is not safe to drink. Actually, this sort of water is not safe for both human and animal consumption. However, it is considered safe for watering plants as is it deemed less salty than faucet water. But still, you should have a second thought on this if you want to use gray water for watering edible plants.</p>

        <p>If you have an aquarium in the house, do not think of using the deposited water from your dehumidifier in your fish tank. Since the water is collected from the moisture in the surrounding, it contains airborne and chemical contaminants. Transferring this into your tank will endanger your fish and can cause the growth of fungi in your tank too.</p>

    <h2>Is dehumidifier needed with air conditioning?</h2>
        <p>Now you might be wondering if you need a dehumidifier if you already run air conditioning. Ideally, an air conditioner lowers humidity naturally as air circulates through its condenser in spite of the conditions outside. Therefore, if it is humid and hot outside, an air conditioner alone can prove effective.</p> 

        <p>However, when the temperature is not that high rather humidity is, then a dehumidifier will come into the application. Apart from reducing humidity in your room, dehumidification decreases the need to run a cooling system because you will still feel comfortable. Therefore, when it is cool outside you don’t need to run an air conditioner, a dehumidifier alone will do you good and save you bills. In any case, they can still run at the same time.</p>

    <h2>Is dehumidifier good for basement?</h2>
        <p>There is no better place to use a dehumidifier than in your basement. Basements normally have a lot of moisture that comes from rain water and other ground liquids. This is the place you want to turn into a store or home laundry and that means it must be habitable.</p>

        <p>Too much moist your basement can cause molds to form on the walls and other assets in there. Molds spores can be harmful to your health causing cold and flu. Some other effects include bad odor in the basement, swelling of wood and rust of metal pipes. The only way to avoid such hazards is to get a dehumidifier for your basement.</p>

    <h2>How long to run a dehumidifier</h2>
        <p>There is no particular length of time that the unit must be in operation. It depends on with the level of humidity in the surrounding. Most modern units are automated that they run independently. Therefore once they perform the task to the required level, they just turn off.</p>

    <h2>How often to use a dehumidifier</h2>
        <p>This too depends on the circumstances. You definitely need it on through winter to protect your house, family, and assets from damp and mold. Some places are wet even through summer so you might still need to use it then. If you have an area in the house where you want to keep up low humidity, you are likely to use it all year round. If you live in relatively hot regions and you run an air conditioner, you probably don’t need a dehumidifier at all.</p>

    <h2>Does dehumidifier kill mold?</h2>
        <p>The dehumidifier does not visibly kill mold till you see its dead. What it does rather is preventing mold from thriving in your house. Mold only needs access to moisture to form. A dehumidifier will help to lower indoor moisture levels and deprive mold of its source of nutrition.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier make room cooler?</h2>
        <p>Somehow, dehumidifiers help to cool down a room, especially if you live in warm, humid regions or during the peak of summer. They do not necessarily work as air conditioners but they can maintain a room in moderate temperature. By absorbing moisture in a room, dehumidifiers make it more comfortable by lowering the room temperature to the set level in the gadget.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier clean the air?</h2>
        <p>The primary function of dehumidifiers is to reduce humidity in a room. While this is helpful in preventing the air from mold spores, it does not filter the air purely from pollen, dust or smoke particles. However, it relatively reduces the dust in a room so you do not need to clean often.</p>

    <h2>Does dehumidifier help with radon?</h2>
        <p> When it comes to dealing with radon, your best bet will be to invest in a radon system. Using a radon system is more efficient and effective in eliminating radon than depending on a dehumidifier.</p>

        <p>A study by Environment Protection Authority (EPA) shows that an efficient dehumidifier will cost around $15 per month in fighting radon. On the other hand, a radon system will cost about $7 a month to run. Therefore, dehumidifiers do help with radon to a little extent.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier need water?</h2>
        <p>The dehumidifier does not need water. Literally, if the machine is filled with water then that will be reversing their process. Dehumidifiers collect air from the surrounding to dry it, not moisturize it and that is what water will do.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier save energy?</h2>
        <p>As long as a dehumidifier is running, it is adding up energy bills. Saving energy is this case means the less time it runs, the lesser bill you will incur. Smart dehumidifiers turn off automatically once relative humidity is attained so somehow they can save a little energy in your absence. But generally, dehumidifiers do not save energy.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier have Freon?</h2>
        <p>Yes. The copper coils in a dehumidifier are filled with Freon. Freon helps to prevent leakage from the coils by recharging them time to time. When air passes through the cool Freon coils, the Freon absorbs heat and moisture from the air. The dehumidified air then passes through another set of coils where it is warmed and released back into the room.</p>


    <h2>Does dehumidifier use a lot of electricity? </h2>
        <p>A lot here will depend on with the capacity of the machine. The energy ratings of dehumidifiers are normally displayed on their backs, so you can check to know how much one will cost running. Running a higher capacity dehumidifier will draw more electricity. However, it will be more energy-efficient and effective because it will clear moist faster than a smaller one. A standard model is said to cost about $150 a year.</p>

    <h2>Would a dehumidifier stop condensation?</h2> 
        <p>This forms part of what they are made to do. A dehumidifier clears moisture in a room and by so doing; it solves the problem of condensation. There must be high levels of moisture in the air for condensation to occur and humidifiers clearly work against that.</p>

    <h2>Would a dehumidifier dry clothes?</h2>
        <p>Dehumidifiers can dry clothes, and dry them soft. All you need to do is put your clothes onto a clothes horse then place the machine nearby, but not too close. You can set your dehumidifier to boost mode to accelerate the drying process.</p>

    <h2>How to choose a dehumidifier?</h2>
        <p> Consider the long term cost of running the machine and the cost of electricity consumption. Look also at the size of the room and the extent of its wetness before purchasing one. Larger machines clear more moisture in a given space and run for fewer hours than smaller ones. </p>

    <h2>How many dehumidifiers do I need?</h2>
        <p>For household use, one machine is enough. They come in different sizes and that determines how much space they can serve. A 5 bedroom house will need a higher capacity dehumidifier than a 2 bedroom house. Place the dehumidifier centrally in your house and leave the doors to all rooms slightly open and it will be effective in the entire house.</p>

    <h2>How many watts does a dehumidifier use?</h2>
        <p>The power rating of dehumidifiers varies from one to another and it is always mentioned by the manufacturer. The number of watts a dehumidifier uses correlate with the relative humidity of the room.  A machine working in a higher humidity level will draw more power than working in the opposite situation. </p>

    <h2>How many hours to run a dehumidifier?</h2>
        <p>There is no set number of hours to run the machine. Dehumidifiers are equipped with auto-off controls that switch off the machine upon reaching the level set on the humidistat.</p>

    <h2>How many pint dehumidifier do I need?</h2>
        <p>This depends on the size and conditions of the area where you want to place the dehumidifier. For instance, a 30-pint dehumidifier is recommended for areas ranging from 1500-2000 square feet. A damp, 2000 square feet area where mold growth can be seen on surfaces might call for a 50-pint dehumidifier. You need a 60-70 pint machine for areas over 2000 square feet.</p>

    <h2>How many rooms does a dehumidifier cover?</h2>
        <p>Presumably, the machine serves an entire house. So whether it is 3 or 5 bedroom, it dehumidifies all the rooms. Of course, the room where the machine is placed will be the driest but being a portable gadget, it can be moved around the house.</p>

    <h2>How many years does a dehumidifier last?</h2>
        <p>The average lifespan of this machine is estimated to be 8 years, working under standard conditions. A consistently used unit will last up to 5 years.</p>

    <h2>How to use a dehumidifier?</h2>
        <p>There are some basics you can do to get the most out of your damp fighting machine. First, place it in a more central place in your house. This will ensure it removes moisture from the room equally.</p>

        <p>Second, learn to get the right humidity level in your house so that you can set the level you want to meet on the humidistat. You can buy a hygrometer to always use it to read humidity levels. Finally, always remember to empty the dehumidifier after every use and this will help it work more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Does dehumidifier work in summer?</h2>
        <p>Of course, it does. Places like basements are never completely dry even in summer and mold can find a way to thrive there with little moisture. A dehumidifier will definitely come into account in such situations.</p>

    <h2>Can I use a dehumidifier in winter?</h2>
        <p>Winters are normally wet meaning plenty of moisture in the atmosphere. This is the best time dehumidifier services are needed.</p>

    <h2>Dehumidifier Safety</h2>
        <p>These appliances come with safety precautions, use and care manuals that you can always follow when installing, running and maintenance. Common sense applies here too.</p> 

    <h2>Does dehumidifier kill flies?</h2>
        <p>A dehumidifier can help in killing flies. Flies only survive in relative humidity that is over 50%. Keeping the relative humidity under 50% for a few days will get rid of flies.</p>

    <h2>Can I use dehumidifier while sleeping?</h2>
        <p>Running this appliance while sleeping will lead to a comfortable sleep. It will help in removing allergens and dust mites in the air that sometimes cause cold and flu.</p>

    <h2>Can dehumidifiers make you sick?</h2>
        <p>This will depend on several conditions. If you constantly use the dehumidifier and normally forget to open the windows to let in fresh air, the house will still be humid. This can cause sneezing and other allergies. If you forget to empty the tank, mold can start forming and it can cause health problems including lung problems. The point of getting sick widely depends on the usage.</p>

    <h2>Would a dehumidifier help with asthma?</h2>
        <p>Mold triggers asthma. Running a dehumidifier in a house occupied by an asthma sufferer can help to reduce the thriving of mold, therefore reducing the effects of asthma. However, it should not be taken as a cure for asthma.</p>

    <h2>Would a dehumidifier help with COPD?</h2>
        <p>COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard for someone to breathe. Using a dehumidifier in a house can help in managing this chronic disease. A dehumidifier controls humidity in a room and creates conducive breathing environment, free from mold spores for the best living of a COPD patient.</p>

    <h2>Is dehumidifier good for allergies?</h2>
        <p>It is perfect for allergies. It captures the excessive moisture in a room that would have formed fungal and mold spores which worsen allergies.</p>

    <h2>Is dehumidifier good for babies?</h2>
        <p>Parents should count this as a worthy investment in their children’s bedrooms. Babies especially will find it hard to doze off in humid conditions because the sweat from their bodies does not evaporate normally. With a dehumidifier, moisture is absorbed from the air allowing them to sweat easily, feel cooler and sleep soundly.</p>

    <h2>Is dehumidifier safe?</h2>
        <p>As far as all the safety regulations are exercised, this machine is safe to use. They help clear mold growth in homes and this is beneficial to human health as it prevents allergies and asthma symptoms.</p>
