    <h1>The Ugliest Vehicles of all Time</h1>
    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/haynes-international-motor-museum-england-uk-729185077">1999 Plymouth Prowler Car</a>

        <p>Have you ever been so shocked by a person’s ugliness that you had to stop to “admire” how bad he or she looks? That’s how you will feel when you see these ugly vehicles.  The word ugly doesn’t completely define how bad these cars look so I’m going to add some more vocabulary: they’re grotesque, hideous, repulsive, unattractive and any other terrible word you can think of. The Fiat Multipla and the Pontiac Aztek are the most famous ugly cars out there but you’ll be shocked to know that they look like beauty queens when they’re compared to some other uglier cars. Everybody translates beauty in his or her own way but you’ll have to be blind not to notice these vehicles’ ugliness. Tighten your seatbelt; it’s time to go for a ride in some of the ugliest cars we can think of.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/kielce-poland-20210628-suzuki-vitara-x90-1999117262">SUZUKI X-90</a>

        <p>This vehicle looks like it was born from an inbred family. It looks like some spoilt Japanese food that can only be fed to the pigs. Just looking at it makes me feel like vomiting! It is much uglier than its close sibling, the Suzuki Sidekick. Its parents must have been sister and brother because it has bad teeth and close-set eyes. The SUZUKI X-90 looks like it might need a hospital because it is definitely sick.</p>


    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bordeaux-aquitaine-france-12-2020-citroen-1875635395">CITROËN AMI</a>

        <p>This vehicle was introduced in 1961. Paris is known as the world’s capital of love but there is nothing lovely about this French-born car. It was inspired by the classic 2CV but it lost its mojo and quickly became a joke. There was nothing lovely about its rectangular headlights, mullet and its polyester leisure suit. The hopeless aerodynamics and dubious aesthetics of its reverse-rake rear window didn’t do it any justice either.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/ascona-switzerland-august-23-2016-amc-1313297405">AMC PACER</a>

        <p>The AMC Pacer was warmly welcomed by car journalists when it arrived in 1975; they described it as "unique," "bold" and "futuristic." The automaker even reacted to the 70s gasoline crisis by making an electric version. However, the good times did not last long. Over time, people began to complain about its unorthodox looks. Instead of being futuristic, it was now seen as a “strange” car. Although it remains popular with car collectors, we still think it is one of the ugliest cars we’ve ever seen.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/vintage-trabant-car-eastern-europe-village-2524343607">Trabant</a>

        <p>The Trabant was as ugly as they come. This poorly designed car was produced in East Germany. The manufacturer of this vintage car wanted to make their own version of the Volkswagen Beetle but they failed miserably. This car is often associated with the failed Eastern Bloc. Doug DeMuro, an automotive journalist, described it as slow, loud and terribly built. It lasted between 1957 and 1990.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/dearborn-miusa-june-17-2017-1973-692848924">AMC GREMLIN</a>

        <p>This one has a name that sounds like a horror movie from the 80s.  It was known for its unique appearance and small size.  It was a subcompact car that looked like a badly-designed sprinting shoe. If the manufacturers were trying to make it look like a Ford Mustang, then they failed spectacularly. We can only describe it as a badly proportioned car that belonged in the 70s.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/astoria-oregon-usa-may-21-2019-2579322471">PONTIAC AZTEK</a>

        <p>The Aztek is uglier than Adolf Hitler’s soul, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. This is one of the cars that appear when you ask Google about the cars with the worst appearances. Many car bloggers put it on top of their “ugliest cars” lists. It is a rebel that violates all the rules of aesthetics. It is hunchbacked and slab-sided. It doesn’t help that the body of this vehicle is carried by roller-skate-sized wheels. Some car enthusiasts believe that the coupe SUVs were inspired by the Pontiac Aztek. The chief designer said that the car’s bold design was only meant for “certain people.” We think that “those people” can only be him and his wife. I mean, who would want a car that looks like the offspring of a Dustbuster vacuum and a Transformers toy.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/novosibirsk-russia-january-15-2024-silver-2418767875">NISSAN CUBE</a>

        <p>If the Nissan Cube was to be judged for its stylistic sins then it would definitely burn in hell! It looks like a giant wooden toy that has been made by a small boy. The left side is wrapped up by an asymmetric rear window that makes it look weird.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bordeaux-france-11-04-2024-volkswagen-2544720167">Volkswagen Type 181</a>

        <p>You don’t want to look at it twice. It looks like a basic piece of metal that has been placed on wheels. In America, it was known as The Thing while the British called it the Trekker. In the 1960s, it was made for the German military. However, mass production began in 1981.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/essen-nov-26-sbarro-autobau-shows-66073024">Sbarro Autobau concept</a>

        <p>This supercar has blade-like things in the front. It looks like it is ready to plough a farm! You might be surprised to learn that it was launched in the Geneva motor show in 2010. Yes, it doesn’t belong in the crazy 80s. It has a weight of 1,500 kilograms. It was made in honor of Fredy Lienhard, a successful Swiss racing driver. The designer must have really hated this racer to come up with such a hideous concept. The only good thing about it was that it was powered by a 12-cylinder mid-mounted engine that was sourced from Ferrari. It delivered 500bhp, this is average when compared to other modern supercars. We’re glad it’s ugly a** disappeared into thin air.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/jesolo-italy-september-2012-fiat-multipla-2241576521">FIAT MULTIPLA</a>

        <p>This vehicle was born in Italy during the Berlusconi-era. It comes with an Elephant Man-esque exterior. From the front, it looks like a UFC fighter with a broken nose. In addition to this, it is full of many strange bulges. People who live in the villages will be forgiven for thinking that it is a giant frog that has mutated. Away from the looks, we love the fact that it is a practical family car that comes with an accommodative cabin. It can carry 6 people and it is enjoyable to drive. Unfortunately, it won’t help you gain any points when you’re trying to impress your crush. Nobody worth his or her salt would like to be seen driving it. Popular entertainment judge Simon Cowell described it as “an animal that has a disease.” I pity the British people who have to see this vehicle almost daily.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/haynes-international-motor-museum-england-uk-729185077">Plymouth Prowler</a>

        <p>This Prowler looks like a javelin spear. This retro-styled production vehicle came with an optional trailer that made it look even uglier. It came with a rear-transmission, rear-drive, front-engine configuration. Its single generation produced 11,702 units. The Plymouth brand dissolved soon after the Prowler was launched. It lasted between 1997–2002.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cliveden-house-taplow-berkshire-england-june-2569959775">Aston Martin Lagonda</a>

        <p>This one has to be Aston Martin’s ugliest car ever built. Just like the 80s, it had no style. It reminds of a terrible moustache on the upper lip – I hope Steve Harvey isn’t reading this.  It was made in Newport Pagnell, England. It can be described as a luxury four-door, full-sized saloon. Although its minimalistic interior had digital instruments and a single-spoke wheel, it was extraordinarily futuristic. The manufacturer made 645 units. Today, the wedge-shaped Lagonda is very popular with collectors; it can demand more than £100,000. It lasted from 1974 to 1990.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/serdang-malaysia-may-242024-1990s-nissan-2506867463">Nissan S-Cargo</a>

        <p>The Nissan S-Cargo looks like a bad mistake; the manufacturer must have made it in a hurry. It can be described as a diminutive retro-styled van.  It looks like a character from the cartoon series “Cars. “ It is so hideous that once you see it, it is impossible to remove it from your head – it reminds me of a bad nightmare. It was made between 1989 and 1991.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/santa-clara-cuba-september-11-2016-1237673572">Ford Edsel</a>

        <p>It is difficult for a car to flop harder than the Edsel did. The Edsel was hyped for a whole year but it still failed spectacularly.  It was meant to be a darling of the Americans but that never came to pass. It wasn’t reliable and it was of low quality. It was pricier than most of the company’s other cars at that time, with a price tag that ranged between $2,500 and $3,800. The recession was just starting in 1958 when it was launched. This turned out to be a terrible miscalculation that resulted in low sales. Ford was forced to abandon this full-size car in 1960. Its looks didn’t help out either. In case you’re wondering, it looked like an old grandfather.</p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/belarus-minsk1303-pt-cruiser-car-parked-2135078469">Chrysler PT Cruiser</a>

        <p>From the front, the Chrysler PT Cruiser looks like a fat cat that is about to throw up! Yes, you’re right, it looks like Garfield. It can be described as a front-wheel drive, front-engine, compact MPV/ small family car. Its styling makes it look like it belongs in the 1930s. It comes with two body styles: a 2-door convertible and a 5-door hatchback. In the inside, it has a high h-point seating, a high-roof, as well as flexible passenger and cargo configurations. Production lasted between 2000 and 2010. </p>

    <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/pangody-russia-july-7-2018-motor-1266098191">PONTIAC TRANS SPORT</a>

        <p>If you think that this vehicle is attractive then you need to have your eyes checked by an optician. This oddly pointy minivan was never supposed to see the light of day. It was produced between 1990 and 1996. In 1997, the manufacturer got rid of the futuristic look and embraced a more conventional look. We’re glad that Pontiac Trans Sport died an early death.</p>
